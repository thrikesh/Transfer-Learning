# Implementation-of-Transfer-Learning
## Aim
To Implement Transfer Learning for classification using VGG-19 architecture.
## Problem Statement and Dataset
Include the problem statement and Dataset
1. Develop a binary classification model using a pretrained VGG19 to distinguish between defected and non-defected capacitors by modifying the last layer to a single neuron.
2. Train the model on a dataset containing images of various defected and non-defected capacitors to improve defect detection accuracy.
3. Optimize and evaluate the model to ensure reliable classification for capacitor quality assessment in manufacturing.

## DESIGN STEPS
<br/>### STEP 1:
Collect and preprocess the dataset containing images of defected and non-defected capacitors.

### STEP 2:
Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.

### STEP 3:
Load the pretrained VGG19 model with weights from ImageNet.

### STEP 4:
Remove the original fully connected (FC) layers and replace the last layer with a single neuron (1 output) with a Sigmoid activation function for binary classification.

### STEP 5:
Train the model using binary cross-entropy loss function and Adam optimizer.

### STEP 6:
Evaluate the model with test data loader and intepret the evaluation metrics such as confusion matrix and classification report.
